# Coding Challenge 34 - Date Night
Build your own version of the below game and add the fun(challenging) CSS animations:*

Last month, I discovered something fun: https://www.datenightquestions.com/

If you click on the above link, you will see that this website has a card animation to drag and flip the questions (cards). In this challenge we are going to try and recreate this effect on our own projects!


## The Rules Are:

1. You will need to create a deck of cards, then make the cards "flip" when you drag and drop. You should be able to achieve this effect with many types of JS libraries (or even pure CSS). The challenge is to use google and figure out how you can do it on your own. Good luck!

2. **You have until January 30th at 11:59pm EST** to submit your project (using Github. If you don't know how to do that, check out the lecture in the Git + Github section of the course). You will have to submit the link to the **#coding-challenge** Discord group with the following message:  *-challenge URL LINK TO YOUR ENTRY"* . The bot will listen for the command and will reply with "thanks for your submission" if it succeeded.

4. Use whatever tools you have as developers (google, friends, Discord, programming buddy etc...) but I will not be offering any help with this challenge. Just like a developer, you must solve a problem and create something unique. Nobody will hold your hand during the job so we want to experience that by figuring it all out on your own with your team. 


## Submissions:

Student Submissions will be posted here at the end of the challenge!


## One Last Thing!

**Please note: As with all of our challenges, there is zero benefit or monetary gain we receive from it. This is just our way of extending the classroom and making sure that you are able to continue gaining valuable knowledge outside of the courses.**
